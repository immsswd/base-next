This helps catch type-related errors at compile time.\n\nDocumentation: Interfaces serve as documentation for your code, making it clear what properties an object should have.\n\nCode Maintainability: Interfaces make your code more maintainable because they define a contract that objects must follow, which helps prevent unexpected changes."
